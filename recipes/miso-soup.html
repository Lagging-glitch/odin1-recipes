        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of dashi—a
          flavorful broth made from simmering kelp, kombu, and bonito fish
          flakes—and miso paste. The soup is further developed by adding cubed
          tofu, wakame, and fresh green onion.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bonito flakes: These thin fish shavings, also known as katsuobushi,
            add great flavor to the dashi stock. They are very delicate, so take
            care when measuring them in a measuring cup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tofu: This recipe calls for medium-hard tofu, but you could use soft
            tofu instead. Tofu is traditionally cut into small cubes and
            simmered in the soup mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dried wakame seaweed: Wakame is a type of dried seaweed that expands
            when rehydrated. It adds a unique texture and flavor to the soup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Miso paste: This is a fermented paste made from soybeans used in
            many Asian dishes. It’s typically made from soybeans and comes in
            white, red, or a blend of the two. The white miso paste is the
            mildest, while the red miso paste is the strongest in flavor and
            saltiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scallions: Sliced thinly, they add a nice contrasting fresh flavor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make the dashi(soup stock):Add the water to a medium pot set over
            medium heat and bring the water to a boil. Once the water has
            boiled, turn off the heat and add the flakes, allowing them to sit
            in the hot water for 15 minutes. Strain the Bonito flakes and
            discard them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer with the tofu and seaweed: Add the tofu and the seaweed and
            return to a simmer over medium heat. Stir to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the miso slurry: Whisk ¼ cup of the broth with the miso
            paste in a medium bowl. Add more broth if needed until the mixture
            is smooth and free of lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine and simmer: Pour the miso mixture back into the pot and
            simmer (don’t boil) for another 5 minutes, stirring regularly to
            prevent the miso from settling on the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve your miso soup with freshly sliced green onions if you like
            and enjoy!
